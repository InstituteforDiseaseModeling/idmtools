Introduction to Analyzers
=========================

Analyzers allow you to look at targeted output data for analysis from aggregated simulation results. For example, if you would like to focus on specific data points from all simulations in one or more experiments then you can do this using analyzers with |DT|.

Example analyzers are inlucded with |DT| to help you get started. You can also create custom analyzers to meet your individual analysis needs. Integration with |SSMT_l| increases the performance of running analyzers. You may find this useful when running multiple analyzers across multiple experiments.

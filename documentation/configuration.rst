Configuration
=============

IDMTools is configured through the idmtools.ini file. The file is normally located in the project directory but 
idm-tools will search up through the directory hierachy for the configuration file


Below is an example configuration file

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/idmtools.ini

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   :titlesonly:
   :caption: Specific configuration items

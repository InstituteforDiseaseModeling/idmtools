Configuration
=============

The configuration of |IT_s| is set in the idmtools.ini file. This file is normally located in the project directory but |IT_s| will search up through the directory hierachy. An idmtools.ini file must be included when using |IT_s|.

Below is an example configuration file:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/idmtools.ini

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

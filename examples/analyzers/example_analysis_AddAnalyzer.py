# Example AddAnalyzer for EMOD Experiment
# In this example, we will demonstrate how to create an AddAnalyzer to analyze an experiment's output file

# First, import some necessary system and idmtools packages.

from idmtools.core import ItemType
from idmtools.core.platform_factory import Platform

    # Set the platform where you want to run your analysis
    # In this case we are running in BELEGOST, but this can be changed to run 'Local'
    with Platform('BELEGOST') as platform:

        # Arg option for analyzer init are uid, working_dir, data in the method map (aka select_simulation_data),
        # and filenames
        # In this case, we want to provide a filename to analyze
        filenames = ['StdOut.txt']
        # Initialize the analyser class with the name of file to save to and start the analysis
        analyzers = [AddAnalyzer(filenames=filenames)]

        experiment_id = 'f227704e-0c34-ea11-a2be-f0921c167861'  # comps2 staging exp id

        # Specify the id Type, in this case an Experiment

"""
Example: Filtering simulations from an experiment using flexible tag-based conditions.

This example demonstrates how to use `get_simulations_by_tags()` with both:
- Static tag values (e.g., "Coverage": 0.8)
- Range tag filters using lambda expressions (e.g., "Run_Number": lambda v: 2 <= v <= 10)

The internal system normalizes tag values (e.g., "0.8" vs 0.8) to ensure consistent matching.

# Development Tips

There is a Makefile file available for most common development tasks. Here is a list of commands
```bash
clean       -   Clean up temproary files
lint        -   Lint package and tests
test        -   Run All tests
coverage    -   Run tests and generate coverage report that is shown in browser
```
On Windows, you can use `pymake` instead of `make`

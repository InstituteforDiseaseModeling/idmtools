Logging
=======


|IT_s| includes built-in logging, which is configured in the [LOGGING] section of the idmtools.ini file, and includes the following parameters: *level*, *console*, and *log_filename*. Default settings are shown in the following example::

    [LOGGING]
    level = INFO
    console = off
    log_filename = idmtools.log

Logging verbosity is controlled by configuring the parameter, *level*, with one of the below listed options. They are in descending order, where the lower the item in the list, the more verbose logging is included.

| CRITICAL
| ERROR
| WARNING
| INFO
| DEBUG

Console logging is enabled by configuring the parameter, *console*, to *on*. The *log_filename* parameter can be configured to something other than the default filename, *idmtools.log*.

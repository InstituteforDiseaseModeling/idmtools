Services on |COMPS_s| with containers
=====================================

When using |IT_s| and containers on |COMPS_s| you can use the following two options:

* Container builder service
* Running simulations using containers


Container builder service
-------------------------

The container builder service in |IT_s| allows you to create a Singularity Image File (SIF), 
the Singularity container file to run in your HPC environment. For more in-depth information 
about the container builder service, see :doc:`containers-builder-service`.

Running simulations using containers
------------------------------------

Whether you've used the container builder service in |IT_s| to create a new SIF file or you've 
downloaded a pre-existing SIF file you can then use it for running simulations with |COMPS_s|. 
For more in-depth information about using containers with |COMPS_s|, see :doc:`containers-comps`.

Welcome to |IT_s|
=================

|IT_l| is a collection of Python scripts and utilities created to streamline user interactions with
disease models. This framework provides the user with tools necessary to complete projects, starting
from the creation of input files (if required), to calibration of the model to data, to commissioning
and running simulations, through the analysis of results. Modelers can use |IT_s| to run models
locally or send suites of simulations to an HPC or other computing source. This framework is
free, open-source, and model agnostic: it can be used to interact with a variety of models,
such as custom models written in R or Python, or IDM's own |EMOD_s|.


|IT_s| workflow
===============

.. high level overview of what the tools do

|IT_s| includes a variety of options for each step of the modeling process. Because of this, the
tool suite was developed in a modular fashion, so that users can select the utilities they wish
to use. In order to simplify the desired workflow, facilitate the modeling process, and make the
model (and its results) reusable and sharable, |IT_s| allows the user to create :term:`assets`.
Assets can be added at any level of the process, from running a specific task, through creating
a simulation, to creating a :term:`experiment`. This allows the user to create inputs based on their
specific needs: they can be transient, or sharable across multiple simulations.

Exact workflows for using |IT_s| is user-dependent, and can include any of the tasks listed below.
To help new users get started, a series of Cookiecutter projects have been added, designed to
guide modelers through necessary tasks. See :doc:`cookiecutters` for the available templates.

.. not sure what to do with catalyst. Not included yet.

.. nothing done with STAMP yet; not sure if it will be some sort of "plug-in" to the tools or totally standalone

.. Nothing here for EMOD API. We'll want to put it *somewhere* and likely have a landing page for it here...

Architecture
============

|IT_s| is built in Python and includes an architecture designed for ease of use, flexibility, and extensibility. You can quickly get up and running and see the capabilities of |IT_s| by using one of the many included example Python scripts demonstrating the functionality of the packages. |IT_s| design includes multiple packages and APIs, providing both the flexibility to only include the necessary packages for your modeling needs and the extensibility by using the APIs for any needed customization.

==========================
Create and run simulations
==========================

To create simulations with |IT_s|, create a Python file that imports the relevant packages, uses the classes and functions to meet your specific needs, and then run the script using ``python script_name.py``.

For example, if you would like to create many simulations "on-the-fly" (such as parameter sweeps) then you should use the :py:class:`~idmtools.builders.simulation_builder.SimulationBuilder` and :py:class:`~idmtools.entities.templated_simulation.TemplatedSimulations` classes. On the other hand, if you would like to create multiple simulations beforehand then you can use the :py:class:`~idmtools.entities.simulation.Simulation` class.


See the following examples for each of these scenarios:
